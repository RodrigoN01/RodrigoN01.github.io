          <h3>
            Former marketer, self-taught software developer, passionate about
            technology and web development.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I started my career as a marketer after graduating from business
            university but found myself spending all of my free time involved
            with technology, building computers, solving problems, spending
            hours in front of the computer and being a reference to my friends
            when it comes to technology. It didn't take long to realize a career
            change was in order, although it took some time to actually make the
            move.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I have had the privilege of working for big
            companies such as Walt Disney and Warner Bros where, not only I was
            able to develope important skills, such as communication and
            leadership, but also understand the the intricacies of a large
            corporation, building relationship with clients, helping them build
            out their brand and become successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my journey into programing and web development in 2019, when
            I decided to dedicate full time to my studies and pursue my dreams
            and do what I am truly passionate about which is web development.
