          <h3>Pixels</h3>
          <p>
            In this article I will be covering a topic that many of us find
            complicated at first and prefer to postpone its learning, but trust
            me, it is worth investing your time on this topic, the relative
            units.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML has been around for 26 years, and pixels have been around as a
            layout measuring unit since then. Pixels did not came out with the
            web, but the pixels we use in the web are not exactly the same
            pixels we knew from before. With that in mind, I thing we should
            question our trust on them.
          </p>
          <h3>Pixels are not absolute</h3>
          <p>
            Not particularly the ones on the web. In fact, their size vary based
            on multiple factors: screen resolution, browser renderer, and device
            renderer, <strong>'1px'</strong> is not the same distance every time
            your UI loads. Knowing that: how far can we rely on an "absolute
            unit" that is not absolute?
          </p>
          <h3>Font based units</h3>
          <p>
            The containers and boxes are sized relatively to the text. We want
            our content to be placed surrounded by the boxes and borders we set.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, CSS provides us with some good tools to solve this problem,
            I will only mention the 3 main ones:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>ch:</strong> a typographic measure based on the length
                of the character 0 (zero).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>em:</strong> a typographic measure based on the length
                of the character 'm'.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>rem:</strong> a web measure based on the
                <strong>'em'</strong> of the root element.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>'em' vs 'ch'</h3>
          <p>
            Now, we need to choose which one gets the job done in a more and
            consistent way. In order to choose, it's required first to
            understand how each of them are defined.
          </p>
          <p>
            In CSS, the <strong>'em'</strong> is a general unit of length
            related directly to font size. We use it to define widths, heights,
            padding, margins and other measurements in both horizontal and
            vertical directions â€“ something typographers with a traditional
            background may find surprising. The <strong>'em'</strong> unit can
            also be used to define the font size itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>'ch'</strong> unit can be useful if you want to set
            lengths or sizes which relate directly to the width of the font.
          </p>
          <h3>The 'm' and its width</h3>
          <p>
            Probably the first question your are asking yourself is, "Why the
            <strong>'m'</strong> ?" When creating a new typeface, designers use
            (or used) a squared block (kerning) which served as reference to
            assure each character was proportionally designed in comparison to
            the other ones. The <strong>'m'</strong> is the only character in
            our entire alphabet that would touch the left and right boundaries
            of this box. So, <strong>'1em'</strong> is actually the maximal
            width of a character, regardless of which font-family it belongs to.
          </p>
          <h3>Absolute zero</h3>
          <p>
            The number zero is normally the average width of all characters
            (alphanumeric) in a typeface. The
            <strong>'ch'</strong> is, therefore, an estimation of the character
            length for a specific font, hence its name (character).
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the zero is an average, it becomes a more reliable unit than
            <strong>'em'</strong>. On the event of a font-family changing for
            the content, the <strong>'5ch'</strong> will continue to be the
            length of 5 characters, whilst <strong>'1em/1rem'</strong> may
            change for more or less than before. In a nutshell,
            <strong>'1ch'</strong> in <strong>Times New Roman</strong> displays
            a different distance than <strong>'1ch'</strong> in
            <strong>'Helvetica'</strong> which would be also different than in a
            monospace typeface.
          </p>
          <h3>Using percentages</h3>
          <p>
            The use of percentages is very common and powerful, but can also be
            tricky. Depending on the CSS property which you're adding a value
            to, the percentage relates to a different measure. For padding and
            margin, for example, the percentage relates to the width of the
            containing box (regardless if it is vertical or horizontal
            padding/margin).
          </p>

          <pre>
<code>
.wrapper {
  width: 10rem; 
  
  height: 3rem;
} 

.child { 
  padding-top: 10%; /* 1rem */
  
  margin-top: 10%; /* 1rem */
}
</code>
          </pre>

          <p>
            Also, if for example you're intending to set a percentage value to
            width, height, and its derivatives, the fraction will correspond to
            its container, so height: 50% is half the height of the elements
            container (given it has a measurable length at parsing time).
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>
.parent {
  width: 40rem;

  height: 20rem;
}

.child {
  width: 50%; /* 20rem */

  height: 70%; /* 14rem */
}
</code>
          </pre>

          <p>
            To some extent, I like to think <strong>'%'</strong> as the
            <strong>'em'</strong>
            equivalent of viewport sizes. They are both extremely powerful, but
            they also require a level of understanding on how CSS rendering will
            work and a more strategic view of how the UI elements will integrate
            and interact with each other because they depend on the context
            where they are inserted.
          </p>
          <h3>Viewport based units</h3>
          <p>
            Viewports, on the other hand, are much more intuitive. It is part of
            CSS3, so they are quite new, though their learning curve helps a lot
            on advocating towards their usage.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>vh:</strong> Viewport height. <strong>1vh</strong> is
                <strong>1%</strong>
                of the actual viewport's height.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>vw:</strong> Viewport width. <strong>1vw</strong> is
                <strong>1%</strong>
                of the actual viewport's width.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>vmax:</strong> Viewport max. <strong>1vmax</strong> is
                <strong>1%</strong> of the viewport's biggest dimension
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <strong>vmin:</strong> Viewport min. <strong>1vmin</strong> is
                <strong>1%</strong> of the viewport's smallest dimension
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As you may have come to realise, the viewport units do not depend on
            the context they are inserted into. So, to keep the comparison
            between units: if <strong>'%'</strong> is the
            <strong>'em'</strong> of viewport, viewport units are the
            <strong>'rem'</strong> .
          </p>
          <h3>So what should we use?</h3>
          <p>
            It's not actually a question of what to use, but more a question of
            when should we use which.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, we should try to find the message on the layout we
            are creating, once we do that, the best unit will reveal itself as
            the one which is more likely to provide a reliable measure of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's go through a quick example, if you have a piece of display
            text-base (e.g.: a blog post), you can narrow it down your options
            to
            <strong>'rem'</strong> , <strong>'em'</strong> , or
            <strong>'ch'</strong> . Now, does the specific element in question
            depends on its parent? (if yes, <strong>'em'</strong> or
            <strong>'ch'</strong> probably). Do you need it to be scalable in
            case you switch typefaces? (if yes, definitely
            <strong>'ch'</strong> ). Of course, this situation is
            oversimplified, but I believe it would provide a good understanding
            of the topic
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, there is no silver bullet and do not be shy of using every
            resource at your disposal.
