        <article class="blog-article">
          <h3>Long Term Goal</h3>
          <p>
          After years of working with something I wasn't happy with, now I know exactly what I want, which is become a full stack web developer. That is a start! To achieve that, there is a long path to pursue, therefore we need a plan.  
          </p>
          <p>
            A couple of years a go, I have started studying web development using mostly what was available online, I've been trying to follow the self-taught route and surprisingly, I was very successful learning by myself, I've managed to stay focus and resilient. I'm not going to lie, learning how to code is extremely difficult and I almost gave up a few times out of frustration, but with support of my family they've encouraged me to keep following my dream, that one day the knowledge would sick in and it will become natural.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perseverant as I am, I kept going, maintaining my focus, keeping an organized study schedule, trying to balance study and work, things started clicking, JavaScript is not as difficult as it was at the beginning, and I am now very proud of how far I've gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coming to Dev Academy has changed the name of the game a bit, I've decided to dive into this industry deep and fill some gaps that I couldn't achieve studying by myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to achieve my goal successfully I need a plan, and here we will start it.
          </p>
          <h3>Learning Strengths and Limitations</h3>
          <p>
            Starting with the limitations, I've mentioned on my other article, is being too perfectionist, this is what hinders my evolution as a developer, I'm very reluctant to publish my project if it's not perfect. I plan to work on that during my time at EDA so I can achieve small successful things along the way. In the programing world, I've learnt that we need to build and practice the more we can, and things don't need to be perfect when you are learning, you just need to try and build.
          </p>
          <p>
            My strength, is the fact that I'm very focus, I can stay in front of the computer for hours, without losing focus, I love coding and debugging and solving problems. I'm very resilient and determined. I've kind of discovered that recently studying by myself, specially if it is a subject that you are interested, it is like binge watching a TV series, you want to see the end result and you will stay focus until the end.
          </p>
          <h3>Human Skills to develop</h3>
          <p>
            The main human skills I want to develop is, listening to others and don't talk too much, sometimes I talk more than others and I am very opinionated, I wish I could listen more to what people have to say and perhaps I would learn much more from everyone else. I think some yoga classes will help me. ðŸ˜†
          </p>
          <h3>The Plan</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Focus and dedication is the most important aspect of learning.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan to go through every content provided by EDA, even if I am familiar with the topic, this will give me the time to practice and revisit some important topics.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Help you and help others</strong></p>
          <p>
            I strongly believe, when you help others you are helping yourself more than you think. By helping others you get the concepts you learnt and try to explain it to your cohort, this helps you fixate that knowledge into your brain and discover gaps on it as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Staying active and participating on the slack channel is a big part of the learning plan, share what you have learnt and what everyone else is learning is crucial to be successful in this journey.
          </p>
          <h3>What I expect from facilitators</h3>
          <p>
            I've had the privilege to meet my facilitator, and I'm glad to have her as my facilitator, she is very nice, calm, and easy going.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel that I can count on her to unblock me from certain parts of the sprints, not only that, I feel that she will be a person who I can count when it comes to sharing my experiences and difficulties throughout the course, a person to chat and discuss what is working and what its not working.
          </p>
          <h3>Commitment</h3>
          <p>
            As I've mentioned before, I'm fully committed to this course. It's not a cheap course, and I want to take the most out of it, I have all the support from my family and they understand if I be bit absent for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            I intend to be committed on the weekends if needed, this is probably the most important career decision I've done in my life, and there is not too much room for failure in this process. My future depends on it.
