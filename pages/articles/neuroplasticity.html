        <article class="blog-article">
          <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong>: The brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. <strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> allows the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities in response to new situations or to changes in their environment.</p>
          <p>Only a few decades ago, we believed that the brain was a nonrenewable organ with a finite amount of neurons. But then we discovered that the strength of connections between neurons can change, something that's called structural <strong>neuroplasticity</strong>.</p>
          <p>We also discovered that neurotransmitters, the chemicals that neurons emit to communicate with each other, can change permanently due to learning and environment, something that's called functional <strong>neuroplasticity</strong>.</p>
          <p>And we discovered that neurons can adapt, reconnect, and possibly even regrow and replenish, something that's called <strong>neurogenesis</strong>.</p>
          <p>The human brain is much more malleable than we once thought it was. Even the adult brain is still biologically capable of extraordinary change.</p>
          <p>The concept of <strong>neuroplasticity</strong> confirms the transformative power of our thought patterns. Our internal monologue is the sculptor of our brain.</p>
          <p><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> is also called brain plasticity or brain malleability. </p>
          <p><strong>Improve Neuroplasticity</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Placing yourself in an environment that emphasizes novelty and challenge is critical for neuroplasticity. Travel is an excellent way to expose the brain to new stimuli.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learning a new instrument or even listening to music increases connectivity between brain regions and may help form new neural networks. Given enough practice, these changes become permanent.</p></li>
            <li><p>Intermittent fasting leads to cellular and molecular adaptations of neural networks in the brain, enhancing its functionality and bolstering it against stress, disease, and injury.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
          <p>A mindset is an attitude or disposition that determines our responses to and interpretations of particular situations. It is shaped by our beliefs and experiences. Think of mindset as the way we approach and deal with particular situations.</p>
          <p>Students with a fixed mindset are those who are more likely to give up easily, whereas students with a growth mindset are those who keep going even when work is hard, and who are persistent. The two mindsets are associated with different achievement pathways as the image bellow shows.</p>
          <img src="/img//Growth-mindset.jpeg" alt="">
          <p>“A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed,”
            <i>(Dweck, 2014).</i> </p>
            <p><strong>Move to a Growth Mindset</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Internalize that you can still learn new things. Neuroplasticity is not pseudo-science. There is genuine research that proves the malleability of your brain, despite your age.</p></li>
            <li><p>Learn something new every day and focus on learning well over learning fast. Progress might be slow at first, but that's almost inevitable. Nothing comes easy. Over time, however, the rewards of a new skill are usually well worth it.</p></li>
            <li><p>Acknowledge and embrace your weaknesses. They're not fixed in stone. You can either focus on making your strengths stronger or you can focus on making your weaknesses somewhat less weak. Just don't lie to yourself about your weaknesses, else you'll never improve.</p></li>
            <li><p>Failures are opportunities, however unpleasant they might be. When Thomas Edison was asked how it felt to have failed 1,000 times before inventing the light bulb, he replied by saying he hadn't failed 1,000 times. The light bulb was simply an invention that required 1,000 steps.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Much of life is how you frame it. Reflect on the areas of your life where you're still stuck in a fixed mindset and think about the ways you can move from fixed to growth. Where could you still improve?</p>
