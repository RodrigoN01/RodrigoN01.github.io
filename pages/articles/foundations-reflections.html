          <h3>What I have learnt about myself</h3>
          <p>
            Three things I have learnt about myself during this first phase of the course.
          </p>
          <p><strong>1 - Resilience</strong></p>
          <p>
            I have been studying Web Development for quite some time now, I have encountered many problems that I found myself stuck for longer than I expected. It is a common problem in this journey and most of the times you find a solution after clearing your head and changing the focus of the problem. Therefore, being resilient is very important, you have to persist on that problem and you will come up with a solution. Taking a few steps back from the problem and viewing from a different angle and doing some research, will increase your chances of finding a solution. So I've been very persistent when it comes to solving difficult tasks.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2 - Morning person</strong></p>
          <p>
            Waking up early and start studying. That's what I've been doing throughout this course and it makes me more productive. My head is clearer and I can concentrate better in the morning. Waking up early also allows for fewer distractions and allows me to define your goals and reach them, it removes the sense of rush you feel throughout the day. Furthermore, it makes me less susceptive to procrastination, it gives me the chance to acknowledge and deal with my studies first thing, so it gives me more room for improving other areas in the rest of the day.
          </p>
          <p><strong>3 - Writing</strong></p>
          <p>
            By writing all this blogs and technical articles, I am learning how to become a better writer. At first, it was a challenge, since I'm writing in a language that is not my native language. But soon I realise that it is similar to programing, with practice you will improve. Moreover, it gives you a chance to reflect on your thoughts and improve your learning abilities. Also, I have learnt, that when I am writing I feel more relaxed and it gives me a chance to focus on something else other than coding.
          </p>
          <h3>Value, Empathy and Self Awareness</h3>
          <p>
            In programming, you can become very isolated in your own world, in many cases you just want to put your headphone and "code away". I know it there a moments that you just need to focus and tackle that problem on your own, however it is very important to get out of your world and communicate with other people, ask them to review your work, listen to other people's opinion, there is always a different perspective of the problem your are trying to solve. Therefore it is important to have Self Awareness, so you can understand how are you feeling, how are you dealing with your issues and how can you become a better person and professional. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is expected from you to be part of a team as a programmer and in any profession in your life, it is almost impossible to achieve great thing without a team, therefore, you will need to have <strong>Empathy</strong> with your teammates, understand what the other person is feeling thinking from their point of view and imagine yourself in their places. Also, acknowledging your <strong>values</strong>  is key part of your personal and professional development, what motivates you to be a better person and how that will reflect on your professional growth.
          </p>
          <h3>Core Learning</h3>
          <p>
            This was a great surprise for me when I started the course, before I started, since the course has such a short length and it is very intensive, I though we would be more focused on learning how to code and we would be immersed on the code editor all the time. However, I was surprised with the <strong>core</strong> content of the course, Emotional Intelligence, Growth Mindset, Listening and Looping. At first I was skeptical, I didn't know what to expect from that, but then I realized how important those concepts are, if not as important or even more important than the technical skills. Those concepts make you a better at teamwork and improve your social skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an open mind I have embraced the <strong>core learning</strong> and it was absolutely worth it. I feel much more inspired to continue studying and developing myself at my own pace, I feel confident that everything is possible and that I can learn new things at any point of my life, and also, that improving your <strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong>, I can go further in my development as a person and as a professional. Spending time on this topic was mind blowing and extremely important, it is a concept that I will never forget and I will plan to keep improving my <strong>'core'</strong>.
