        <article class="blog-article">
          <p>In this article, we'll look to understand the importance of Emotional Intelligence and how it can influence your professional and personal life</p>
          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence</h3>
          <p>Emotional intelligence or EI is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions, and those of the people around you. People with a high degree of emotional intelligence know what they're feeling, what their emotions mean, and how these emotions can affect other people.</p>
          <h3>Differences between IQ and EQ</h3>
          <p>Emotional intelligence refers to a person's ability to perceive, control, evaluate, and express emotions.</p>
          <p>Intelligence quotient, or IQ, is a number derived from a standardized intelligence test. On the original IQ tests, scores were calculated by dividing the individual's mental age by their chronological age and then multiplying that number by 100.</p>
          <p>It is known by many specialists that having a strong EQ plays a important role in your professional growth and there are some differences when comparing with IQ such as:</p>

              <h3>IQ</h3>
              <p>IQ measures cognitive abilities, such as</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The ability to learn</li>
                <li>The skilled use of reason</li>
                <li>To think abstractly as measured by objective criteria (such as test)</li>
                <li>Mental acuteness</li>
                <li>Logic and analytical skills</li>
              </ul>

              <ul>
                <li>Empathy</li>

          <h3>Why EQ is so important</h3>
          <p>At one point in time, IQ was viewed as the primary determinant of success. People with high IQs were assumed to be destined for a life of accomplishment and achievement, and researchers debated whether intelligence was the product of genes or the environment (the nature versus nurture debate).</p>
          <p>However, some critics began to realize that high intelligence was no guarantee for success in life. It was also perhaps too narrow a concept to fully encompass the wide range of human abilities and knowledge.</p>
          <p>Experts recognize that IQ is not the only determinant of life success. Instead, it is part of a complex array of influences—one that includes emotional intelligence. Many companies now mandate emotional intelligence training and use EQ tests as part of the hiring process.</p>
          <p>Being able to understand your emotions is fundamental to understanding what will lead you to flourish and become more high-functioning. That’s because as humans, we tend to be highly emotional and social creatures.</p>
          <p>Being emotionally intelligent will help you connect with others, boost your performance at work, improve your communication skills, become more resilient, and more. It turns out that having a high level of EI can make you successful in just about every aspect of your life.</p>
