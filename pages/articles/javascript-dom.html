        <article class="blog-article">
          <p>
            In this article we will cover the basic concepts of
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> and how to navigate and traverse the
            <strong>DOM</strong>, in order to make your website interactive.
          </p>

          <h3>JavaScript and HTML CSS</h3>
          <p>
            It is important to understand a little bit of the history of the
            language. <strong>JavaScript</strong> was created in 1995 by Brendan
            Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> was first released with Netscape 2 early
            in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was
            renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to
            capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's
            <strong>Java</strong> language â€” despite the two having very little
            in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far we have learnt that, <strong>HTML</strong> and
            <strong>CSS</strong> are programming languages (in my opinion, some
            may disagree), that don't use logic, <strong>HTML</strong> is where
            you set the basic structure of the page, is the most basic building
            block of the Web, It defines the meaning and structure of web
            content and <strong>CSS</strong> where you give style to that page.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is an advanced programming language that
            makes web pages more interactive and dynamic. It manipulates content
            to create dynamic web pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            My analogy to understand these three concepts, think of
            <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> as the structure of
            the car, the paint job and all the accessories.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the engine that makes it run, it
            provides fuel to the car so you can interact with it.
          </p>

          <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
          <p>
            The control flow is the order in which the computer executes
            statements in a script. In <strong>JavaScript</strong>, we read the
            code starting from the first line till the last line unless of
            course in the code there is some instructions or statements that
            changes that control flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most well known control flow is the
            <strong>'if'/'else'</strong> statement. For instance, you want a
            website to show a page <strong>'if'</strong> you are older than 18,
            otherwise or <strong>'else'</strong>, the website would render a
            different page, this is a conditional statement. The code would be
            something like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
  <code>
      if(age === 18) {
        // Load the page
      } else {
        // Warning page!
      }
  </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Another very common conditional statement used as control flow is
            the <strong>'switch'</strong> statement
          </p>
