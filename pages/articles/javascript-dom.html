        <h1 class="blog-title">JavaScript and DOM</h1>
        <article class="blog-article">
          <p>
            In this article we will cover the basic concepts of
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> and how to navigate and traverse the
            <strong>DOM</strong>, in order to make your website interactive.
          </p>

          <h3>JavaScript and HTML CSS</h3>
          <p>
            It is important to understand a little bit of the history of the
            language. <strong>JavaScript</strong> was created in 1995 by Brendan
            Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> was first released with Netscape 2 early
            in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was
            renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to
            capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's
            <strong>Java</strong> language — despite the two having very little
            in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far we have learnt that, <strong>HTML</strong> and
            <strong>CSS</strong> are programming languages (in my opinion, some
            may disagree), that don't use logic, <strong>HTML</strong> is where
            you set the basic structure of the page, is the most basic building
            block of the Web, It defines the meaning and structure of web
            content and <strong>CSS</strong> where you give style to that page.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is an advanced programming language that
            makes web pages more interactive and dynamic. It manipulates content
            to create dynamic web pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            My analogy to understand these three concepts, think of
            <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> as the structure of
            the car, the paint job and all the accessories.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the engine that makes it run, it
            provides fuel to the car so you can interact with it.
          </p>

          <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
          <p>
            The control flow is the order in which the computer executes
            statements in a script. In <strong>JavaScript</strong>, we read the
            code starting from the first line till the last line unless of
            course in the code there is some instructions or statements that
            changes that control flow.
          </p>
          <p><strong>if/else statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            The most well known control flow is the
            <strong>'if'/'else'</strong> statement. For instance, you want a
            website to show a page <strong>'if'</strong> you are older than 18,
            otherwise or <strong>'else'</strong>, the website would render a
            different page, this is a conditional statement. The code would be
            something like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
  <code>
      if(age >= 18) {
        // Load the page
      } else {
        // Warning page!
      }
  </code>
          </pre>
          <p><strong>Switch statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            Another very common conditional statement used as control flow is
            the <strong>'switch'</strong> statement. The switch statement is
            used when you have to use many if statements in the same function,
            it evaluates an expression, matching the expression’s value to a
            case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>
  switch(car){
    case 'has no gas':
      // go to the gas station
      break;
    case 'flat tyre':
      // replace tyre
      break;
    default:
      // start the engine
  }
</code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            If you don't add the <strong>break</strong> statement, the execution
            will 'fall through' to the next level. This may not be what you
            want, in case you want that to happen you can specify and it is
            worth commenting to show your intentions.
          </p>
          <h3>Loop</h3>
          <p><strong>'for' loop</strong></p>
          <p>
            Creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed
            in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement
            executed in the loop.
          </p>
          <p>the syntax of the <strong>for</strong> loop is:</p>
          <pre>
<code>
for(initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
    // for loop body
}
</code>
          </pre>
          <ol class="blog-list">
            <li>
              the initialExpression initializes and/or declares variables and
              executes only once.
            </li>
            <li>
              The condition is evaluated.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the condition is <strong>false</strong>, the
                  <strong>for</strong> loop is terminated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the condition is <strong>true</strong>, the block of code
                  inside of the <strong>for</strong> loop is executed
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>The updateExpression update s the value of the initialExpression when the condition is <strong>true</strong></li>
              <li>The condition is evaluated again. This process continues until the condition is <strong>false</strong></li>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>for...in</strong></p>
          <p>
            Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary
            order. For each distinct property, statements can be executed.
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>
let obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
    
for (const prop in obj) {
  console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`);
}
// Output:
// "obj.a = 1"
// "obj.b = 2"
// "obj.c = 3"
</code>
          </pre>
          <p><strong>for...of</strong></p>
          <p>
            Iterates over iterable objects (including arrays, array-like
            objects, iterators and generators), invoking a custom iteration hook
            with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct
            property.
          </p>
          <pre>
<code>
let iterable = [10, 20, 30];

for (let value of iterable) {
  value += 1;
  console.log(value);
}
// 11
// 21
// 31
</code>
          </pre>
          <h3>The DOM</h3>
          <p>According to <strong>W3C</strong>, the document object model (DOM) is an "application programming interface for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated".</p>
          <p>In simple terms, the DOM is a representation of your HTML to the browser and allows you to manipulate the page.</p>
          <img src="/img/DOM.png" alt="the DOM">
          <p>It is often referred to as a tree because the <strong>DOM</strong> with a single parent item that branches out into children items. These children items can also branch out into their own smaller trees like what you see in the photo above.</p>
          <p>While the <strong>DOM</strong> sounds like this super intimidating thing, it's actually how browsers determine what is rendered on our page and, through <strong>JavaScript</strong>, is how we can manipulate those elements that are rendered.</p>
