        <h1 class="blog-title">JavaScript and DOM</h1>
        <article class="blog-article">
          <p>
            In this article we will cover the basic concepts of
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> and how to navigate and traverse the
            <strong>DOM</strong>, in order to make your website interactive.
          </p>

          <h3>JavaScript and HTML CSS</h3>
          <p>
            It is important to understand a little bit of the history of the
            language. <strong>JavaScript</strong> was created in 1995 by Brendan
            Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> was first released with Netscape 2 early
            in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was
            renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to
            capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem's
            <strong>Java</strong> language — despite the two having very little
            in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far we have learnt that, <strong>HTML</strong> and
            <strong>CSS</strong> are programming languages (in my opinion, some
            may disagree), that don't use logic, <strong>HTML</strong> is where
            you set the basic structure of the page, is the most basic building
            block of the Web, It defines the meaning and structure of web
            content and <strong>CSS</strong> where you give style to that page.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is an advanced programming language that
            makes web pages more interactive and dynamic. It manipulates content
            to create dynamic web pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            My analogy to understand these three concepts, think of
            <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> as the structure of
            the car, the paint job and all the accessories.
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> is the engine that makes it run, it
            provides power to the car so you can interact with it.
          </p>

          <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
          <p>
            The control flow is the order in which the computer executes
            statements in a script. In <strong>JavaScript</strong>, we read the
            code starting from the first line till the last line unless of
            course in the code there is some instructions or statements that
            changes that control flow.
          </p>
          <p><strong>if/else statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            The most well known control flow is the
            <strong>'if'/'else'</strong> statement. For instance, you want a
            website to show a page <strong>'if'</strong> you are older than 18,
            otherwise or <strong>'else'</strong>, the website would render a
            different page, this is a conditional statement. The code would be
            something like this:
          </p>
<pre><code> if(age >= 18) {
    // Load the page
  } else {
    // Warning page!
  }
</code></pre>
          <p><strong>Switch statement</strong></p>
          <p>
            Another very common conditional statement used as control flow is
            the <strong>'switch'</strong> statement. The switch statement is
            used when you have to use many if statements in the same function,
            it evaluates an expression, matching the expression’s value to a
            case clause, and executes statements associated with that case.
          </p>
<pre><code> switch(car){
    case 'has no gas':
      // go to the gas station
      break;
    case 'flat tyre':
      // replace tyre
      break;
    default:
      // start the engine
  }
</code></pre>
          <p>
            If you don't add the <strong>break</strong> statement, the execution
            will 'fall through' to the next level. This may not be what you
            want, in case you want that to happen you can specify and it is
            worth commenting to show your intentions.
          </p>
          <h3>Loop</h3>
          <p><strong>'for' loop</strong></p>
          <p>
            Creates a loop that consists of three optional expressions, enclosed
            in parentheses and separated by semicolons, followed by a statement
            executed in the loop.
          </p>
          <p>the syntax of the <strong>for</strong> loop is:</p>
<pre><code> for(initialExpression; condition; updateExpression) {
    // for loop body
 }
</code></pre>
          <ol class="blog-list">
            <li>
              the initialExpression initializes and/or declares variables and
              executes only once.
            </li>
            <li>
              The condition is evaluated.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If the condition is <strong>false</strong>, the
                  <strong>for</strong> loop is terminated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the condition is <strong>true</strong>, the block of code
                  inside of the <strong>for</strong> loop is executed
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>The updateExpression update s the value of the initialExpression when the condition is <strong>true</strong></li>
              <li>The condition is evaluated again. This process continues until the condition is <strong>false</strong></li>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>for...in</strong></p>
          <p>
            Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in arbitrary
            order. For each distinct property, statements can be executed.
          </p>
<pre><code> const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
    
  for (const prop in obj) {
    console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`);
  }
  // Output:
  // "obj.a = 1"
  // "obj.b = 2"
  // "obj.c = 3"
</code></pre>
          <p><strong>for...of</strong></p>
          <p>
            Iterates over iterable objects (including arrays, array-like
            objects, iterators and generators), invoking a custom iteration hook
            with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct
            property.
          </p>
<pre><code> const iterable = [10, 20, 30];

  for (let value of iterable) {
   value += 1;
   console.log(value);
  }
  // 11
  // 21
  // 31</code></pre>
          <h3>The DOM</h3>
          <p>According to <strong>W3C</strong>, the document object model (DOM) is an "application programming interface for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated".</p>
          <p>In simple terms, the DOM is a representation of your HTML to the browser and allows you to manipulate the page.</p>
          <img src="/img/DOM.png" alt="the DOM">
          <p>It is often referred to as a tree because the <strong>DOM</strong> with a single parent item that branches out into children items. These children items can also branch out into their own smaller trees like what you see in the photo above.</p>
          <p>While the <strong>DOM</strong> sounds like this super intimidating thing, it's actually how browsers determine what is rendered on our page and, through <strong>JavaScript</strong>, is how we can manipulate those elements that are rendered.</p>
          <h3>Objects and Arrays</h3>
          <p><strong>Objects</strong></p>
          <p>Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics. In objects, these characteristics are called properties that consist of a key and a value.
          </p>
<pre><code> // Basic object syntax
 const object = {
   key: 'value'
 };

 // Example 'person' object
 const person = {
   name: 'Zac',
   age: 33,
   likesCoding: true
 };
</code></pre>
          <p><strong>Accessing data from objects</strong></p>
          <p>Properties in objects can be accessed, added, changed, and removed by using either dot or bracket notation. To get the value of the age key in our personobject with both dot and bracket notation, we’d write:</p>
<pre><code> // Dot notation
 person.age // returns 33

 // Bracket notation
 person['age'] // returns 33
</code></pre>          
          <p><strong>Arrays</strong></p>
          <p>We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their numerical position in the list. Just as object properties can store values of any primitive data type (as well as an array or another object), so too can arrays consist of strings, numbers, booleans, objects, or even other arrays.</p>
          <p><strong>Accessing data from arrays</strong></p>
          <p>Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of 0, the second item an index of 1, and so on. For instance, let’s say we wanted to access the third item (‘Mexico City’) in the following array:</p>
<pre class="lang-js"><code> const cities = ['Tokyo', 'Bali', 'Mexico City', 'Vancouver'];

 cities[2]; // returns 'Mexico City'
</code></pre>
          <p>Objects represent “things” with characteristics (aka properties), while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable. Both dot and bracket notation allow us to access, add, change, and remove items from an object, while zero-based indexing and a variety of built-in methods let us access and alter items in an array. </p>
          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p><strong>What is a Function?</strong></p>
          <p>A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task. Functions are executed when they are called. This is known as invoking a function. Values can be passed into functions and used within the function. Functions always <strong>return</strong> a value. In <strong>JavaScript</strong>, if no <strong>return</strong> value is specified, the function will return <strong>undefined</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Define a function</strong></p>
          <p>A <strong>Function Declaration</strong> defines a named function. To create a function declaration you use the function keyword followed by the name of the function. When using function declarations, the function definition is hoisted, thus allowing the function to be used before it is defined.</p>
<pre><code> function name(parameters){
   statements
 }
</code>
</pre>
          <p><strong>Parameters vs Arguments</strong></p>
          <p>If you’re new to JavaScript, you may have heard the terms parameters and arguments used interchangeably. While very similar, there is an important distinction to make between these two keywords.</p>
          <p><strong>Parameters</strong> are used when defining a function, they are the names created in the function definition. In fact, during a function definition, we can pass in up to 255 parameters! Parameters are separated by commas in the (). Here’s an example with two parameters — <strong>param1</strong> & <strong>param2</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>  const param1 = true;
  const param2 = false;
  function twoParams(param1, param2){
    console.log(param1, param2);
  }
</code>
</pre>
          <p><strong>Arguments</strong>, on the other hand, are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed (invoked). In the above example, our two arguments are true & false.</p>
          <p>
            That was a lot of information, and there is still a lot to cover in
            this topic. <strong>JavaScript</strong> has unlimited possibilities,
            it's one of the most versatile and flexible programming languages,
            so don't worry if you don't know it all, you never will, for now,
            lets focus on the fundamentals.
