        <h1 class="blog-title">Identity and Values</h2>
        <article class="blog-article">
          <h3>Personal values and ethics</h3>
          <p>
            Iâ€™ve had the privileged to travel to many countries and live in some of them for a while, that gave me a perspective of the world where I could understand the differences in culture, lifestyle, morals and many other interesting things about those places.
          </p>
          <p>By living that experience, I was able to understand and respect all the differences, enjoy and appreciate them, it is incredible how much can you learn from people that are different from you, different beliefs, different language, different culinary, it is amazing how satisfying experiencing those things are, you grow up as a person, you develop more compassion and become more grateful and appreciative for life.</p>
          <p>Iâ€™ve been living in New Zealand for 5 years, and ever since day one I fell in love for this country, Iâ€™ve never felt so welcomed in a foreign country such as here, it is a very multicultural country and everyone is used to living in a such diverse community, I intend to stay here for a long time and help the development of the country and now with software development skills I think I will be able to contribute even more.</p>
          <p>Even though I've been living away from home for such a long time, I try to keep my traditions so I don't feel too homesick. My wife and I, we are both from Brazil, and we try to cook some traditional food from our regions in Brazil, we talk to our parents every day via Zoom or WhatsApp, we like to listen to brazilian music and try to keep our culture close to us.</p>
          <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
          <p>
           When it comes to strengths, I am very perseverant and I never give up easily. If I start something I need to finish and I try to do everything the best way a can. Now, I don't know if this is a strength or a weakness, but I am very perfectionist, for instance, my website, I didn't want to publish it before it was perfect, sometimes that can block me from moving forward, in the programming world, sometimes you need to ship something or build something 'acceptable' rather than not publishing anything at all. I saw myself many times not publishing a project because it wasn't perfect.
          </p>
          <p>During this learning phase, being perfectionist is not a good thing, because you have to build something even if it's not perfect, however, being perfectionist is having attention to detail, being organized, setting priority and optimizing your work and your life.</p>
          <p>Gathering evidences of my personality from my friends and family, there is one main aspect of my personalty that was unanimous amongst their opinion, the fact that I'm very opinionated and that I talk more than listen. This is something that I'm working on... Yoga maybe ðŸ˜†</p>
          <p>Recently, I've been doing some job interviews for developer roles, and one thing that bothered me a lot, was to come home a keep overthinking, what I could've done differently, what I could've said, and that stresses me out a bit and gives me anxiety. Again, it relates to trying to be perfect all the time, not making mistakes, but that is humanly impossible.</p>
          <p>The best strategy to overcome this anxiety is exercising, changing the focus, and trying to stay healthy, if your body is healthy your mind is healthy. Furthermore, I am keen to join the Yoga sessions at EDA.</p>
